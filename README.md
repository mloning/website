# My website

My personal website built with [Hugo] and a modified [Ezhil] theme.

[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io
[Ezhil]: https://github.com/mloning/ezhil

## Local development

* `gh repo clone https://github.com/mloning/website . -- --recurse-submodules` to clone the repo with the theme as a [git submodule]
* `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` to update the theme from the git submodule
* `./run.sh server` to start the Hugo server with hot reloading
* `./run.sh new <name>` to create a new draft in `./content/posts/<name>.md`

[git submodule]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

## Deploy 

Pushing changes to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment using a GitHub Action [workflow] and GitHub Pages.
