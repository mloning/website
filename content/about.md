I am a Machine Learning Engineer.
I'm particularly interested in time series.
I co-created [sktime] (now also forked into [aeon]), an open-source Python library that provides a unified framework for machine learning with time series.

I treat my website like a living document: most posts describe ideas on a particular topic which I grow and cultivate, like a [digital garden](https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/digital-gardening).
I also like the idea of [link blog], sharing interesting links with commentary or examples.

I completed my PhD at [UCL] and [The Alan Turing Institute].
During my PhD, I worked on the design and implementation of [sktime].
Previously, I studied [Philosophy & Economics] at [Bayreuth University], and worked on [empirical economics, international trade and climate policy]. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at [Lancaster University].

I enjoy mentoring less-experienced developers, and have mentored for [Google Summer of Code], [Outreachy], [Major League Hacking] and [Nuffield Research Placements].

I read on [Goodreads]. I like to listen to music on [byte.fm] and watch films on [Mubi].
