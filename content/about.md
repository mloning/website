Hi, I'm Markus. 

I'm a machine learning engineer interested in building end-to-end applications. 

I'm passionate about time series modelling, software engineering and open source. 
During my PhD at [UCL] and [The Alan Turing Institute], I co-created [sktime], an open-source library for machine learning with time series (also see [aeon]).

I enjoy mentoring less-experienced developers and mentored for [Google Summer of Code], [Outreachy], [Major League Hacking] and [Nuffield Research Placements].

In the past, I studied [Philosophy & Economics] at [Bayreuth University], a small but excellent program where I learnt a lot, worked with leading economists and [published] my thesis on climate policy.

I read on [Goodreads]. I like to listen to music on [byte.fm] and watch films on [Mubi].
