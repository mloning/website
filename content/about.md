I'm an ML Engineer, currently working at Snap on real-time signal processing for see-through AR glasses called [Specs](https://www.spectacles.com/).

I'm particularly interested in time series.
I co-created [sktime] (now also forked into [aeon]), an open-source Python library that provides a unified framework for ML with time series data.

I treat my website like a living document: most posts describe ideas about a particular topic, which I grow and cultivate, like a [digital garden](https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/digital-gardening).
I also like the idea of a [link blog], sharing interesting links with comments and examples.

I completed my PhD at [UCL] and [The Alan Turing Institute].
During my PhD, I worked on the design and implementation of [sktime] as well as the benchmarking of time series algorithms.
Previously, I studied [Philosophy & Economics] at [Bayreuth University], and published my Master's thesis in empirical economics on [international trade and climate policy]. 

I really enjoy mentoring and working with others, colleagues but also outside of work. 
I have given tutorials at PyData conferences, and volunteered for [Google Summer of Code], [Outreachy], [Major League Hacking] and [Nuffield Research Placements].
I currently help out at [Les Enfants de la Goutte d'Or], a local after-school study group for kids.

I keep the books I read on [Goodreads].
I like to listen to music on [byte.fm], and watch films on [Mubi].
