## Cultural-fit interview

- [https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-pass-any-first-round-interview](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-pass-any-first-round-interview)
- [https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629)

Types of behavioural questions:

1. **Pure** — “Tell me about a time when ...”
2. **Situational** — “Put yourself in this situation; what would you do?”
3. **Theoretical** — “What’s your general approach to doing X?”

### Discuss specific examples

Similar to CV or cover letter, ideally, give a concrete example for every skill you try to demonstrate.

#### How to pick examples

Pick examples that are:

- **Recent**, ideally within last 3 years
- **Large in scope** (important to the business, strategic, involves lots of stakeholders, significant revenue or user impact)
- **Complex** (in terms of the stakeholders, core team, tech, timeline, resources, etc.)
- **Significant** in terms of personal involvement/contribution

#### Use STAR++

**Situation** - what was the situation you had to deal with

- the strategic driving factors for the project - unlocking TAM, opening new markets, improving COGS, driving user success, other?
- how you got involved - did you come up with the project? get tapped on the shoulder? pick it up when it was a flaming hot mess?
- who was involved - leaders, stakeholders, customers, core team members

**Task** what was the task you were given to do

- success criteria - how was success defined? This is a great time to establish how impossibly complex the project was (which sets you up to be the hero in your stories)
- why was it complex - new tech? huge scope? tight timeline? massive team? powerful stakeholders? major financial impact?

**Action** - what action did you take

- what you did to drive success - specific actions you took
- issues that came up - people, tech, implementation, partners, infra, etc
- conflict that arose - executive sponsors, team members, your boss?

**Result** what happened as a result of your action

- this should include final outcomes for the stated success criteria as well as longer-term success and strategic / business impact

**(+) Learning** what you learned

**(+) Evolution** how you evolved your approach and incorporated learnings in a future situation

### Example questions to prepare

- How do I see my career progression?
- Describe your ideal team culture
- Describe a difficult bug and how you solved it
- Hard technical problem
- Inspire change in ways of working
- What was some recent critical feedback I received and what did I learn from it?
- How do you share feedback?
- What was a recent personal conflict and how did you manage it?
- Why do you want to change your job now?

I outline my thoughts and resources on some of these questions below:

### Question: How do I share feedback?

- [https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/radical-candor-kim-scott](https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/radical-candor-kim-scott)
- [https://hellojames.co.uk/writing/better-feedback/](https://hellojames.co.uk/writing/better-feedback/?utm_source=pocket_reader)

#### Create the environment

- State that you invite and welcome feedback
- Repeatedly ask for and insist on you getting critical feedback
- Build personal relationships and trust
- Start new relationships by giving positive feedback
- State intentions why you give feedback, i.e. to learn, to help other become better and to create a cultural in which we can exchange feedback constructively, so that everyone can learn from direct feedback
- In some situations, state intentions why you give feedback in a certain way (e.g. if public feedback, not to shame or embarrass others but so that everyone can learn and discuss)

#### Give feedback

- Depends on relationship and trust with person I want to give feedback to
- Usually private, especially if personal or no little trust with other person (“criticise in private, praise in public”)
- Give feedback quickly, ideally immediately after the situation
- Give feedback frequently
- Be objective and specific: situation, observed action, impact; clear instructions on how to do better
- “Show, don’t tell” – show concrete examples
- Find help for person if something bigger to learn
- Check if person understood and received feedback constructively, otherwise listen, understand and iterate

### Question: How do I manage personal conflicts?

- [https://liamrosen.com/arguments.html](https://liamrosen.com/arguments.html?utm_source=pocket_reader)
- [https://charity.wtf/2023/08/17/how-to-communicate-when-trust-is-low-without-digging-yourself-into-a-deeper-hole/](https://charity.wtf/2023/08/17/how-to-communicate-when-trust-is-low-without-digging-yourself-into-a-deeper-hole/?utm_source=pocket_reader)

#### Listen

- Give the other person as much time as they need to give their feedback or explain their point of view without interrupting
- Try to understand their needs and emotions, check your understanding with them
- Summarise your understanding of what they said to them and check if you understood their point of view correctly
- Ask for instructions on what you can do to change, to make things easier for the other person

#### Resolve

- Try to rebuild a relationship of trust, by repeatedly explaining your intentions, listening and cross-checking with them your understanding of their point of view
- Spend more time with person to become more familiar with them
- Try to find a compromise that both are happy with
- Seek help if it becomes more serious or you feel that you’re stuck, e.g. Code of Conduct, team leadership, ask trusted external person for advice

### Question: Why join company XYZ now?

- convey what you bring to the role (the compelling ones for the employer)
- explain how this role will accelerate your career (the strategic reasons), give 2-3 specific reasons

### Question: Present your current project

1. High-level overview
   1. Business goals
   2. Users
   3. Technical challenge
2. Ways of working
3. Results
4. Retrospective
   1. What would you change if you could start over again?
   2. What would you optimise going forward?

### Approach

1. Clarify
2. Sketch
3. Refine
4. Review

#### Clarify

- Define functional requirements (restrict problem scope)
- Define non-functional requirements (reliability, availability, scalability, security)
- Ask questions to constrain problem to particular aspects/components/use cases (e.g. suggest to skip login/authentication/role-based authorization)
- Estimate some high-level numbers, including data sizes (e.g. 10 PB), number of requests, ingress/egress data transfer rate (e.g. 10 Gbps)
- Define product/system success metrics (read vs write heavy system)
- Get buy-in from interviewers

#### Sketch

- Lay out basic components (e.g. client app, load balancer, backend web servers, database)
- Get buy-in from interviewers

#### Refine

- Datastore design
  - Considerations: access patterns, mutable/writable vs immutable/read-only data, read vs write heavy, read/write performance scaling for increasing data sizes
  - Database types: relational/SQL (mysql, postgres), document/NoSQL (dynamo, cosmos), graph-based, blob storage (S3)
  - Schemas (data fields/types, table schemas), stable or likely to change
  - Replication (backups, geo-distributed depending on hot requests, downtime/availability)
  - Storage tiers (cold storage, archiving)
- Caching: cache responses to hot requests (local caching for web servers, shared caching for web servers, edge servers, client-side caching)
  - Stateless, important data needs to be persistent in data store
  - Expiry policy
  - Consistency between cache and database
- Load balancing: balance load across servers based on key metrics (CPU/GPU utilisation, network bandwidth, number of requests)
- Scaling
  - Vertical vs horizontal scaling

#### Review

- Summarise how design solves use cases
- Discuss costs and potential cost trade-offs (cloud vs on-prem, cloud managed vs build-your-own)
- Discuss potential problems/bottlenecks, strength/weaknesses
- Discuss any open questions
- Discuss ways to further improve design

### General tips

- Communicate as much as possible
- When stuck or unsure about requirements/priorities, ask for advice
- If you don’t know the answer to a question, try to formulate questions or your approach how to find a solution to the question (e.g. read the docs of a method/class, review the implementation/interface of a particular data structure)

### Practice

Leetcode  
Simulate interview situation as closely as possible

### Approach

1. Clarify
2. Plan
3. Implement
4. Review

#### Clarify

- Summarise
- Ask questions about priorities (e.g. demonstrating best practices, design/structure, code memory/compute efficiency)
- Consider edge cases

#### Plan

- Add type annotations for key types if skeleton classes/functions are provided
- Write skeleton classes/functions if not provided
- Focus on data structure (e.g. array, hashmap, hashset, list)
- Add TODO comments in skeleton code

#### Implement

- Iterate quickly
  - Try to get an end-to-end solution up and running quickly
  - Then improve iteratively
- Demonstrate best practices (docstrings, tests, assert statements for input checks, type annotation), giving a few examples is sufficient

#### Review

- Discuss algorithm memory and time complexity
- Discuss strength/weaknesses
- Discuss best practices (adding docs, tests)
- Discuss potential refactoring/design improvements

### General tips {#general-tips-1}

- Communicate as much as possible
- When stuck or unsure about requirements/priorities, ask for advice
- If you don’t know the answer to a question, try to formulate questions or your approach how to find a solution to the question (e.g. read the docs of a method/class, review the implementation/interface of a particular data structure)

## Questions to ask

- [https://posthog.com/founders/what-to-ask-in-interviews](https://posthog.com/founders/what-to-ask-in-interviews)
- [https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2022/09/questions-to-ask-prospective-employer.html](https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2022/09/questions-to-ask-prospective-employer.html)
- [https://archive.is/aCVkR](https://archive.is/aCVkR)

### What’s your role?

- What’s the core machine learning problem you’re solving?
- What is the main challenge you’re currently facing? Why have you not solved it yet?

### What's daily work like?

- What does a typical day look like for a developer?
- How does your code go from idea to production? Explain it in detail (project management, review, deployment)
- What’s the process to fix a simple error, e.g. a typo in a comment or documentation? How long does it take? Who needs to approve?
- Do you have CI/CD set up? Which tools do you use? How long does it take? Ideally, \< 10 mins.
- Can I see some code? _I believe there are very few legitimate reasons they won't show you their code, but more likely if they're refusing, it's because they're hiding something._
- What do you like least about your work? What would you change? What has stopped you from changing it?
- Have you got an internal package registry? Try to understand how they reuse each others’ code and work across teams.
- Could you explain the exact steps needed to get the code built?
- Can you build the code and run tests on the local machine as if it was a standard desktop application?
- Suppose the team needs to start a new web service like a private Gitlab, add a new type of CI to the testing pipeline or something similar. Could you explain the exact steps needed to get it fully operational? Please list all people who need to do work to make this happen (including just giving authorization), and time estimates for each individual step.
- How many different IT support organisations do you have? Where are they physically located? The only really acceptable answer is "in the same country as your team" (There are exceptions, such as being the only employee in a given country working 100% remotely). Any other answer means that support requests take forever to get done and are a direct and massive drain on your productivity. The reason for this inefficiency is that if you have your "own" support then you can communicate with each other like regular human beings. If they are physically separated then you just become just another faceless person in a never ending ticketing queue somewhere and things that should take 15 minutes take weeks (these people typically need to serve many organisations in different countries and are chronically overworked). The situation is even worse if the IT support is moved to a physically distant location and even worse if it is bought as a service from a different corporation. A typical case is that a corporation in Europe or USA outsources all their IT support to India or Bangladesh. This is problematic, not because people in said countries are not good at their jobs (I've never met them so I can't really say) but because these transfers are always done to minimise costs. Thus a core part of the organisation's engineering productivity is tied to an organisation that is 5-10 time zones away, made the cheapest offer and over which you can't even exert any organisational pressure over should it be needed. This is not a recipe for success. If there are more than one such external companies within the organisation, failure is almost guaranteed.
- Does this team or any of the related teams have a person who actively rejects proposals to improve the code base? A common dysfunction in existing organisations is to have a "big fish in a small pond" developer, one that has been working on said code for a long time but which has not looked at what has been happening in the software development landscape in general. They will typically hard reject all attempts to improve the code and related processes to match current best practices. They typically use phrases like "I don't think that would improve anything", "That can't work (no further reasoning given)" and the ever popular "but we already have \[implementation X, usually terrible\] and it works". In extreme cases if their opinions are challenged they resort to personal attacks. Because said person is the only person who truly understands the code, management is unwilling to reprimand them out of fear that they might leave.

### What’s the bureaucracy like?

- Do developers have full admin rights on their machines? While blocking admin rights might make sense for regular office workers it is a massive hindrance for software developers. They do need admin access for many things and not giving it to them is a direct productivity hit. You might also note that Google does give all their developers root access to their own dev machines and see how they respond.
- Are developers free to install the operating system on their machines?
- What’s the release process? How long does it take? Who needs to approve?
- Suppose that I need to purchase some low-cost device like a USB hub for development work. Could you explain the procedure needed to get that done?

### What's the culture like?

- [https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-developer-culture-test/](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-developer-culture-test/)

* What are the company values, and why? Can you give me some specific ways you've followed them?
* Who decides what to build?
* What are the things or behaviours that would cause a person in this role to fail/succeed?
* Please list all the ways you are monitoring your employees during work hours. For example, state whether you have a mandatory web proxy that everyone must use and enumerate all pieces of security and tracking software you have installed on employees' computers. Do you require all employees to assign all work hours to projects? If yes, what granularity? If the granularity is less than 1 hour, does your work sheet contain an entry for "entering data into work hour enumeration sheet"?

### How strong is the team?

- Can you tell me about the team I'd be working with most closely?
- How do you attract and retain really strong hires?
- Do you share management/board slides with the team?
- How do you compensate the team?
- Can I meet the team in person?

If you want to learn in this role ask yourself: do you believe this company is able to attract people who are as good as or better than you?

You are trying to understand if they view engineering as a cost centre (aka a higher chance you'll be miserable there\!) or not. Thoughtful answers to how to hire and pay people indicate this is prioritised. Sharing more information rather than less shows trust and partnership with employees.

### What’s the vision of the project and team?

- What motivates you as the team lead? What drives you to lead the team?
- Where do you see the project and team in 3 years?

### Startup: What's the vision of the company?

- What motivates you? What motivated you to found the company? What motivates you to lead the team?
- What are you most proud of so far?
- Do you plan to sell the company?

You can't guarantee that plans won't change, but this gives you some indication of what is in store and it helps you understand the founders' motivation better.

- What's the company strategy and why?

You are looking for a simple answer - otherwise the company and the product will end up a bit of a mess. At PostHog, we define strategy as simply "Nail X", where X is the thing we need to nail. We're currently focused on [Nail Self Serve](https://posthog.com/blog/changing-to-self-serve).

- How do you and the other founders avoid falling out?

One of the most common ways for an early stage company to die is that the founders break up. Hopefully they've put some proactive thought into their relationship.

- What keeps you up at night?

This will reveal perhaps what the hardest challenge will be, and where you could add the most value if you joined

### Startup: Does the company have product-market fit?

- "Do you ever question if you have product-market fit?"
- "When did you reach product-market fit? How did you know?"
- "What do you need to do to get to product-market fit?"
- "What's your revenue? What was it a year ago?"
- "How many daily active users do you have?"

This is the single most important thing a company can do to survive and grow. It's ok if these answers show you the founder doesn't have [product-market fit](https://posthog.com/blog/product-market-fit-game). In this case, figure out if they will get to a yes. Unless you want to join a sinking ship, of course\!

Early stage founders are (or should be) super-mega-extra-desperately keen to have product-market fit – it's all that really matters. The ones that will succeed are those that are honest about this (or those that have it already) and are prioritizing it. Many will think or say (intentionally or through self-delusion) that they have it when they don't.

Low user or revenue numbers and vague answers to the example questions above are a sign that it isn't there. Product-market fit [is _very_ obvious](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5z-the-real-product-market-fit).

Avoid:

- Founders who aren't spending a ton of time talking and selling to users pre-product-market fit – it's a flag to attempt to outsource/delegate this
- Companies where you don't understand the product or its benefits – if it can't be explained to you, others will struggle
- Solutions looking for a problem

If there is no product-market fit, but you think the team could find it, it's very important the company has lots of runway (it'll be hard to raise more money without product-market fit, so time to find it is crucial), doesn't have a huge team (it's harder to make rapid changes in direction with a lot of people), and moves fast (look out for bureaucracy, management, or a team that can't work well with ambiguity).

### Startup: What does the financial situation look like? How much runway does the company have? Does their spending look within reason?

- "Are you [default alive](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html)?"

This means that the company whilst not profitable, is growing fast enough that it will become profitable ahead of running out of money.

This means:

- Avoid companies that don't know if they're default alive or don't care about it, given [the current climate](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/06/the-venture-slowdown-isnt-coming-its-here/) – this may change in an easier fundraising environment for early stage, capital-intensive business models
- Avoid companies that you don't believe could get to default alive because they don't have enough time or are too slow to get things done

There are exceptions. For example, very low revenue numbers may lead to unrealistic growth rates – if I went from $1 to $2 of revenue yesterday, I'd be pretty darn rich if I kept that growth rate up.

- "What's your runway?"
- "What assumptions are you making to calculate this?"
- "What are your fundraising plans?"

If a company doesn't have product-market fit, spending should be minimal so there's as much time as possible to find it. Spending a lot and having a big team just makes it harder to change direction rapidly.

If a company has strong product-market fit _and_ has a ton of traction, a shorter runway is ok.

Avoid:

- Companies that assume wild increases in revenue to survive, within a short timeframe
- Companies that are fundraising as they'll otherwise run out of money, but haven't closed the round

## Interview feedback

### Your feedback

Considerations:

- Express excitement about opportunity and willingness to learn
- Show critical self-reflection and self-awareness of areas where to improve
- Describe how opportunity aligns with your career goals
- Potentially reveal your weakness which they had not noticed

Example message:

> Hi \[RECRUITER\],
>
> I’m really excited about \[COMPANY\] and I would love to further explore the opportunity of joining your data science team.
> I had some time to reflect on my technical interviews.
> I realise that my performance may not have been perfect, particularly on the efficient use of data structures.
> While I understand the concepts and their importance, in my work experience there have been other bottlenecks and I haven’t had much opportunity to apply and optimise them.
> This is why I have started learning new programming languages like Rust and why working at \[COMPANY\] is so appealing to me—I'm genuinely eager to learn and improve in these aspects.
>
> I’m looking forward to hearing back from you,
>
> \[NAME\]

## Negotiation

### Negotiating mindset

- [https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)

Do not fall into the trap of valuing companies solely along one dimension. That means don’t just value companies based on salary, equity, or even on prestige.

Those are all important dimensions, but so are cultural fit, the challenge of the work, learning potential, later career options, quality of life, growth potential, and just overall happiness. There are many dimensions in a job negotiation: salary, signing bonus, stock, a year-end or performance bonus, commuter benefits, relocation expenses, equipment, an educational stipend, a child care stipend, extra vacation time, a later start date, getting a dedicated hour a day to work out or study or meditate or play solitaire. You could choose which team you’re assigned to, what your first project will be, what technologies you’ll be working with, and sometimes even choose your title. All of these things matter, and your decision should be genuinely multi-dimensional.

Be open to being surprised as you explore different companies.

It’s also important to understand that companies don’t all value you along the same dimension either. That is, different companies are genuinely looking for different skills, and there are some companies at which you will be more and less valuable.

The more companies you talk to, the more likely you are to find a company to which you are significantly more valuable than the rest. Chances are this is where you’ll be able to negotiate your strongest offer. Remember that a job search is a 2-sided process.

One of the most valuable things you can do for yourself in this process is to really try to understand how employers think and what motivates them. Understanding your interlocutor is extremely important in negotiation.

Be curious about the other side. Try to understand why employers think the way they do. Be sympathetic toward them. Care about what they want and help them try to get it. Adopting this mindset will make you a much stronger negotiator, and accordingly, a much better employee and team member.

### Ten rules of job negotiation

- [https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)
- [https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/](https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/)

#### 1. Get everything in writing

Everything significant you discuss should have some kind of a paper trail. Often, the company won’t even send you an official offer letter until a deal is finalised. So it falls to you to confirm all of the important details in subsequent emails.

After getting the first offer, send a follow-up email confirming all of the details you discussed with your recruiter so you have a paper trail. Just say “_just wanted to confirm I had all the details right._“

#### 2. Always keep the door open

Your recruiter will now say something along the lines of “_so what do you think?_“

This seems innocuous, but your reply here is critical, because there’s a lot you can say to weaken your position. This is your first decision point.

A decision point is a moment in the negotiation where your interlocutor wants to compel you to make a decision. If they succeed in tying you to a position, they will close the door on further negotiating.

Avoid premature commitment, always keep the door open. Never give up your negotiating power until you’re absolutely ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision.

This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating.

#### 3. Information is power

To protect your power in the negotiation, you must protect information as much as possible.

In many situations, the only reason why you have any negotiating power at all is because the employer doesn’t actually know what you’re thinking. They might not know how good your other offers are, or how much you were making in your last job, or how you weigh salary vs equity, or even how rational you are as a decision-maker. You want them to be uncertain on exactly what it would take to sign you.

A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies what you’re currently making. There are some exceptions, but as a rule you should assume this. If you must divulge what you’re making, you should be liberal in noting the total value of your package (incorporate bonuses, unvested stock, nearness to promotion etc.), and always mention it in a context like “_\[XYZ\] is what I’m currently making, and I’m definitely looking for a step up in my career for my next role._“

Reply to first offer: “_Yeah, \[COMPANY_NAME\] sounds great\! I really thought this was a good fit, and I’m glad that you guys agree. Right now I’m talking with a few other companies so I can’t speak to the specific details of the offer until I’m done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I’m sure we’ll be able to find a package that we’re both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team._“

#### 4. Always be positive

Even if the offer is unattractive, it’s important to remain positive and excited about the company. This is because _your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a negotiation._ If you lose your excitement for the company during the interview process, then they’ll lose confidence that you’ll actually want to work hard or stay there for a long time.

So despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1\) you still like the company, and that 2\) you’re still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they’re working on, and really want to see things work out.

#### 5. Don’t be the decision maker

Say: “I’ll look over some of these details and discuss it with my \[FAMILY/CLOSE_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT_OTHER\]. I’ll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I’ll be in touch\!”

Even if you don’t particularly care what your friends/family/husband/mother thinks, by mentioning them, you’re no longer the only person the recruiter needs to win over. There’s no point in them trying to bully and intimidate you; the “true decision-maker” is beyond their reach.

#### 6. Have alternatives

If you’re already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should be if you’re doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you’ve just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency.

> Hi \[PERSON\],
>
> I wanted to update you on my own progress.

Either way, send out a letter like this to every single company you’re talking to. No matter how hopeless or pointless you think your application is, you want to send this signal to everyone who is considering you in the market.

Second, if there are any other companies you are looking to apply to (whether through referral or cold application), or even companies at which you’ve already applied but haven’t heard back, I would also follow up with a similar email.

Companies have only weak information about the candidate from the hiring process, screening, interviews, test scores. Offers from other companies give the hiring company additional weak signals that the candidate is a strong choice. A candidate having multiple offers means that they have multiple weak signals in their favour. Combined, these converge into a much stronger signal than any single interview.

This effect is strengthened if you get an offer from a prestigious company. And the effect goes through the roof if you have an offer from a company’s primary competitor

In negotiation literature, your best alternative is often referred to as your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Basically, it’s what you’d do if you walked away.

I like the term BATNA a lot, mostly because it sounds like a gadget Batman would lob at bad guys.

So what’s your BATNA if you don’t have other offers? Do you even have one?

Of course you do. Your best alternative might be “interview at more companies” or “go to grad school” or “stay at your current job” or “go on sabbatical in Morocco for a few months” (as it was for a friend of mine who was deliberating between joining a startup and gallivanting through North Africa).

The point is, you don’t need to have another offer to have a strong BATNA. _Your BATNA’s strength comes from 1\) how strong the other side perceives it to be, and 2\) how strong you perceive it to be._

If your recruiter thinks that going to grad school is an awesome thing to do, then they’ll see you as having a very strong alternative, and the stakes of the negotiation will be raised.

But even if they think grad school is ridiculous, if you convince them that you’d be totally happy to go to grad school, then the burden is on them to make this deal more attractive to you than going to grad school.

Thus, _you need to communicate your BATNA_. This doesn’t need to be ham-fisted, but you need to make it a background to the negotiation. (Note: usually whenever you signal your BATNA, you should also re-emphasize your interest in reaching an agreement).

Examples:

I’ve received another offer from \[OTHER CORP\] that’s very compelling on salary, but I really love the mission of \[YOUR COMPANY\] and think that it would overall be a better fit for me.

I’m also considering going back to grad school and getting a Master’s degree in Postmodern Haberdashery. I’m excited about \[YOUR COMPANY\] though and would love to join the team, but the package has to make sense if I’m going to forgo a life of ironic hatmaking.

Note: one of the biggest mistakes I see here is from people who are currently working. If you already have a job, staying where you are is often your BATNA.

This means if you tell your interlocutor that you hate your job, then they know your BATNA sucks, and have no incentive to negotiate with you (on top of potentially thinking that you’re a negative person).

Always emphasize the pros of your current company, your seniority, your impact, and whatever else you like about where you currently work.

_You should make your decision seem genuinely close for it to be a strong BATNA_.

#### 7. Proclaim reasons for everything

Stating a reason makes any request feel important and understandable, both for yourself and for your negotiating partner. For example, you’re not just being greedy, it’s you trying to fulfil your goals.

The more unobjectionable and sympathetic your reason, the better.

- I’m earning-to-give, so since I’m donating 10% of my income to charity, I have to negotiate aggressively to leave myself enough to live off
- I really want to buy a house within the next year; what can we do to improve the salary?

#### 8. Be motivated by more than just money

- how much training you get (new programming language, deep learning, etc)
- what your first project will be
- which team you join
- who your mentor will be
- company values/product/mission
- open-source work
- company support for social events (hosting meetups, etc)

#### 9. Understand what they value

#### 10. Be winnable

Be open, be honest (while protecting your information), be communicative  
Be clear with your preferences and timelines  
Don’t interview or negotiate with companies where you cannot imagine at least some package they could offer that would make you sign

### Making the final decision

- Be clear about your deadline
- Assert your deadline continually
- Use your final decision as your trump card

Not necessary to have a clear deadline at beginning  
But set a clear deadline during intermediary stages

Should be a business day (e.g. Mon or Fri) so that you can communicate with recruiters  
proclaim a reason for it (e.g. weekend with family/friends as other decision makers)

avoid any on-the-spot decision points or premature promises

Make companies aware of your deadline; this raises stakes and galvanises negotiations as the deadline approaches

Basically, I want to see the strongest offer your company can muster. Then I will go into my cave, meditate for 10 days, and when I emerge I will have decided in my heart which company to join

Always wait until the last day to sign your offer

Play your trump card: If you can do X, I will sign.

Hi Joel, I’ve been thinking it over and it’s genuinely a really tough decision for me. I loved everyone at \[COMPANY\] but the one thing that makes it hard for me is the salary. As you know I’m trying to pay off my student loans so salary is really important to me right now. If you can improve the salary by 10K a year, then I’ll be totally ready to sign.

Tell all of the other parties that you’ve made your final decision. Thank them for the negotiation.

> Dear \[RECRUITER\],
>
> I hope this email finds you well.
> After careful deliberation, I’ve decided not to proceed with the opportunity at \[COMPANY\].
> Over the last week, I’ve advanced in the interviews with a few other companies that align more closely with my professional goals.
>
> Thank you for the chance to interview with you.
> I have really appreciated your time and consideration throughout the process.
>
> Kind regards,  
> \[NAME\]

### How to give the first number

Better to not give the first number, but if unavoidable, appeal to an objective metric, such as industry standard, emphasise that this is a starting point:

I know that the average software engineer in Silicon Valley makes roughly 120K a year salary. So I think that’s a good place to start.

### How to ask for more

Always state a reason why you’re asking for more (see above)

#### Assert your value

Assert your value, emphasise the unique value you’ll be bringing to the company; whatever you assert should be something you’ve touched on earlier in your discussions, but it’s okay to repeat it now as a gentle reminder.

I believe I bring a lot of experience leading a team of XXX developers, and I’m confident that I’ll be able to bring your XXX offerings up to parity with your competitors.

#### Ask for more salary

Salary is almost always the hardest to give:

- paying someone significantly more salary can cause unrest
- tightly constrained by pay bands

Depending on your leverage (other offers, BATNA), you have two options:

##### Not convincing enough

> I appreciate the work you guys put into constructing this offer.
> But there were a couple things I was unsatisfied with.

> The offer you guys extended was strong.
> Right now my decision is basically between you and \[XYZ CORP\].
> It’s a genuinely difficult decision for me, but there are a couple of dimensions where, if this offer improved, it would be much more compelling.

##### Dissatisfied

> I appreciate the work you guys put into constructing this offer.
> But there were a couple things I was unsatisfied with.

### Other things to ask for

- One-off signing bonus
- Budget for home office (desk, screens, etc)
- Commuter expenses
- Dedicated open-source time
- Dedicated learning time
- Budget for conferences
- Charity donation matching

## How to handle recruiters

- [https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start](https://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start)
- [https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)

Until you’re ready to negotiate, your default mode should be “passive information gathering.”

- Be polite and gracious to a fault. If it’s an offer call, thank them for the work they did to put your offer together and for advocating for you. If it’s earlier in the process, thank them for their help so far.
- Express genuine enthusiasm. If it’s an early call, express excitement about the company or the interview process if there’s something idiosyncratically cool about it. If it’s an offer call, express excitement for the team, the projects, the hiring manager, whatever it is. And be genuine. Every offer will have something exciting about it.
- If the recruiter is making an offer, express enthusiasm and say that you need some time to process and/or talk to your {family, partner, spouse}. No one is realistically expecting you to react to major life decisions on the fly\!
- Use email, not phone when possible and not texts (less casual, more time to think/plan, more level playing field due to lack of experience in conversations compared to recruiters)

#### Email vs phone

Talking on the phone not only signals confidence, but more importantly, it allows you to build a strong relationship with your recruiter. Talking on the phone enables building a connection. You want your recruiter to like you, understand you, empathise with you, and want you to succeed.

However, if you don’t have confidence in your negotiation skills, you should try to push the negotiation to email. Written, asynchronous communication will give you more time to strategize and make it easier to say uncomfortable things without being pressured by a recruiter.

If you want to stick to email, you just be honest and ask for what you want. Tell them:

Hi recruiter, I hope your day is treating you well\!

Re: your previous email, I’d prefer to discuss the details of the offer over email. I sometimes get nervous during important phone calls, so discussing the offer over email helps me to keep a clear head and communicate more clearly. I hope this is okay with you.

#### Handling exploding offers

Exploding offers are offers that expire within 24-72 hours.

You won’t see this much at big companies, but they’re becoming increasingly common among startups and mid-sized companies.

Exploding offers are a natural weapon for employers to combat a strong hiring market for tech workers. Companies know exactly what they’re doing with exploding offers—they play on fear and limit your ability to seek out counteroffers.

In a sense, it’s unsurprising that if startups have more difficulty attracting and securing talent, they’d resort to this practice. What I don’t like is the dishonesty about it. Employers often justify this by saying “_If you need more time than this, then that’s a sign you’re not the kind of person we’re looking for._“

So what should you do if you receive an exploding offer?

Exploding offers are anathema to your ability to effectively navigate the labour market. Thus, there is only one thing to do. Treat the offer as a non-offer unless the expiration window is widened. In no uncertain terms, convey that if the offer is exploding, it’s useless to you.

Example conversation:

I have one big concern. You mentioned that this offer explodes in 48 hours. I’m afraid this doesn’t work at all for me. There’s no way that I can make a decision on this offer within a 48 hour window. I’m currently wrapping up my interview process at a few other companies, which is likely to take me another week or so. So I’m going to need more time to make an informed decision.

If they push back and say this is the best they can do, then politely reply:

That’s really unfortunate. I like \[YOUR COMPANY\] and was really excited about the team, but like I said, there’s no way I can consider this offer. 48 hours is just too unreasonable of a window. The next company I join will be a big life decision for me, and I take my commitments very seriously, so I want to be sure I’m making a well-considered decision. I also need to consult with my \[EXTERNAL_DECISION_MAKER\]. There’s no way that I can make a decision I’m comfortable with in this short amount of time.

Pretty much any company will relent at this point. If they persist, don’t be afraid to walk away.

#### For questions about compensation expectations at the beginning of the process

At this point, I don’t feel equipped to throw out a number because I’d like to find out more about the opportunity first – right now, I simply don’t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.

I don’t have any particular numbers in mind. I’m more interested in learning whether this will be a good mutual fit. If it is, I’m open to exploring any offer so long as it’s competitive.

#### For when a recruiter provides you a salary range and asks you to comment on it at the beginning of the process

Thank you for sharing that with me. Right now, I don’t know enough about the opportunity to value it concretely. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.

#### For questions about compensation expectations at the end of the process

It sounds like there’s an offer coming, and I’m really excited about it. I’m not sure exactly what number I’m looking for, but if you’d be able to share what an offer package might look like, then I will gladly iterate on it with you if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.

#### For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the beginning of the process

I’m currently speaking with a few other companies and am at various stages with them. I’ll let you know if I get to the point where I have an exploding offer, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.

#### For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the end of the process

I’m wrapping things up with a few companies and in process with a few more. I promise to keep you in the loop, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.
