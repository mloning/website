[Money Stack Exchange answer]: https://money.stackexchange.com/a/26370/127647

| Layer | % | Contributors | Shares | Total Shares | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 50 | 2 founders | 2 x 2,500 | 5,000 |
| 2 | 10 | 4 | 4 x 250 | 6,000 |
| 3 | 10 | 20 | 20 x 50 | 7,000 |
| 4 | 10 | 100 | 100 x 10 | 8,000 |
| 5 | 10 | ... | ... | 9,000 |
| 6 | 10 | ... | ... | 10,000 |

where

* each layer represents a growth phase, with the first layer including the founders which distribute 5,000 shares equally among them, and each subsequent layer distributing another 1,000 shares,
* contributors represent the number of people joining the startup in each layer,
* shares gives the distribution of shares in each layer,
* total shares gives the number of shares accumulated over layers, with 10,000 being the final number of shares distributed among contributors,
* the % is relative to final number of shares after all growth phases in which shares are given out (i.e. 10,000)
