- `quarto` for publication-ready reports and presentations (see e.g. https://github.com/paddyroddy/talks)
- optimal transport theory and Python library (https://github.com/PythonOT/POT)
- free-threaded Python rollout (see https://labs.quansight.org/blog/free-threaded-python-rollout, https://lwn.net/Articles/1025893/)
- conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) for lock-free concurrent read/write access, they don't need locks because they accept conflicts but define rules ("merge" operations) that resolve conflicts (e.g. used collaborative text editors like Google Docs)
