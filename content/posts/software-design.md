from https://www.tedinski.com/2018/12/05/types-as-design-tool.html:

> A function is the quintessential abstraction boundary.
> It’s one of the few cases where we should be able to ignore the details.
> (Performance still matters, of course, but even that’s something we can understand in a black-box fashion.)
> We can write better and worse quality functions, but the internal details aren’t really relevant to the software’s overall design.
> It should be isolated.
>
> I think design is about everything that’s leftover after we remove all the function bodies.
> It worth taking a moment to think about what that looks like.
