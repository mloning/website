I went to EurIPS 2025 in Copenhagen, the first edition of the European version of NeurIPS.

Tuesday (ELLIS UnConference)

- Klaus-Rudolf Kladny "Aligning Generative Models with Reality", causal backtracking
- Shih-Chii Liu (ETH and University of Zurich): Brain-inspired dynamic sparsity for neuromorphic AI; voice commands, low-power speech decoding, end-to-end hardware/software systems
- Nasir Ahmad (Radboud University Nijmegen): Two steps forward and no steps back: Training neural networks in noisy hardware without backward passes; starting with observation of relative cheapness of neural network inference to training, weight/layer/node perturbation learning as alternative to back propagation, utilizing information from multiple forward passes for each training update; utilizing gradient information to inform search direction; would allow perturbing models at inference and aggregating results across servers (decentralised, federated training); however, backward pass is only about twice as expensive as forward pass;
- Learning Interpretable Hierarchical Dynamical Systems Models from Time Series Data (poster), modelling user specific parameters for time series, with applications on EEG data ([repo](https://github.com/DurstewitzLab/HierarchicalDSR))

Wednesday (first conference day)

- Is Limited Participant Diversity Impeding EEG-based Machine Learning? ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13497))
- Framework for Emotion Evaluation using Physiological Signal Data ([repo](https://github.com/alchemy18/FEEL))
- Brain Capture, easy-to-use, medical wet-electrode EEG device ([website](https://www.braincapture.dk/))
