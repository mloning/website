I went to EurIPS 2025 in Copenhagen, the first edition of the European version of NeurIPS.

Tuesday (ELLIS Unconference)
- Klaus-Rudolf Kladny "Aligning Generative Models with Reality", causal backtracking
- Shih-Chii Liu (ETH and University of Zurich): Brain-inspired dynamic sparsity for neuromorphic AI; voice commands, low-power speech decoding, end-to-end hardware/software systems
- Nasir Ahmad (Radboud University Nijmegen): Two steps forward and no steps back: Training neural networks in noisy hardware without backward passes; starting with observation of relative cheapness of neural network inference to training, weight/layer/node perturbation learning as alternative to back propagation, utilizing information from multiple forward passes for each training update; utilizing gradient information to inform search direction; would allow perturbing models at inference and aggregating results across servers (decentralised, federated training); however, backward pass is only about twice as expensive as forward pass;

Wednesday (first conference day)
