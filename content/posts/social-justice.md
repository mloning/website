The relationships between people within in our society is, at least partly, characterised by socially constructed power hierarchies (racism, sexism, etc.), with some people being more privileged and others less (social constructivism).
If we change our social interactions (actions, speech, symbols), we can deconstruct these hierarchies.

We should try to make our society just (moral premise).
If relationship are characterised by these hierarchies, our society is unjust (social justice).
If we deconstruct these hierarchies, we try to make our society just (necessary but not sufficient condition for justice).

Therefore, we should try to deconstruct these hierarchies.
