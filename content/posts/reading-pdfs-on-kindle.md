While [sending a PDF file to your Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle) is easy, depending on the PDF format, being able to read it well in the Kindle format can be a challenge.

Fortunately, there is a command-line tool called [k2pdfopt] which allows to reformat a PDF file into a more Kindle-friendly format.

Check out the documentation [here](https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/help/mac.shtml).

More recently, I discovered on [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43073969) some alternatives to using a Kindle:

- [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/)
- [Kobo](https://fr.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders)
